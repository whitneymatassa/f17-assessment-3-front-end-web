    <h2>About Whitney:</h2>
    <p>I really don't feel like typing or thinking about personal information on or about myself to share here. I am just going to freestyle ramble some things to fill this space. I am really tired and super hungry right now. This weekend is the 12th and 9th birthdays of my dogs, Lagertha and Reptar. I am taking them to the White Mountains to go sledding. It is unlikely they will actually sled though, I expect I will sled and they will chase me concerned. I also plan to google where I can find a dog bakery to order a lavish cake for them. I really think I should just get more dogs and never have kids. Dogs let you sleep and never talk back.</p>
